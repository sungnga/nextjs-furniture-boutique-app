# NOTES ON BUILDING THIS WEB APP

### PROJECT SETUP
- Download starter project directory from https://github.com/reedbarger/react-reserve
- Install and update the project dependencies by running:
  - `npm install`
  - then `npm update`
- To start up Next.js server and the project, run: `npm run dev`


### WORKING WITH REACT + NEXT.JS
**1. Create App Layout Component, Build Header Component**
- The Layout component is wrapped around the `<Component />` in _app.js file. This will override the default App.js and the layout defined in the Layout component will persist on every page
- Include the Semantic-UI-React stylesheet in Layout.js file
- The Layout component renders the HeadContent, Header Components, and children components
- All the contents inside the Layout component will be rendered on every page. For example, the Header component which contains the navbar will be rendered on every page
- The Header component contains the navbar menu with links that takes user to that particular page
  - Use Link component provided by Next.js to create the links
    - `import Link from 'next/link';`
  - Write a condition that check whether the user is currently logged in or not
  - If user not logged in, show the Login and Signup links and hide the Create link
  - If user is logged in, show the Account link and Logout button 
  - Use Semantic UI to style the Header component
