# MY NOTES WHEN BUILDING THIS WEB APP

### PROJECT SETUP
- Download starter project directory from https://github.com/reedbarger/react-reserve
- Install and update the project dependencies by running:
  - `npm install`
  - then `npm update`
- To start up Next.js server and the project, run: `npm run dev`


### WORKING WITH REACT + NEXT.JS
**1. Create App Layout Component, Build Header Component**
- The Layout component is wrapped around the `<Component />` in _app.js file. This will override the default App.js and the layout defined in the Layout component will persist on every page
- Include the Semantic-UI-React stylesheet in Layout.js file
- The Layout component renders the HeadContent, Header Components, and children components
- All the contents inside the Layout component will be rendered on every page. For example, the Header component which contains the navbar will be rendered on every page
- The Header component contains the navbar menu with links that takes user to that particular page
  - Use Link component provided by Next.js to create the links
    - `import Link from 'next/link';`
  - Write a condition that check whether the user is currently logged in or not
  - If user not logged in, show the Login and Signup links and hide the Create link
  - If user is logged in, show the Account link and Logout button 
  - Use Semantic UI to style the Header component

**2. Get Route Data From useRouter Hook, Create Active Links**
- Since we're using a function component, Next provides a React useRouter() hook that gives us information from our router
- `import { useRouter } from 'next/router'`
- When execute, it will return a router object: `const router = useRouter()`
- We can get information about what path we're on from the router object by using the property `router.pathname`
- We can use this information to set the navbar menu item to be active when a user is on that particular route
- In Header.js file:
  - Write an isActive function that checks whether the given route matches with `router.pathname`. Return true or false
  - If it is matched, apply the `active` property to that navbar menu item
  ```js
  import { useRouter } from 'next/router';

  function Header() {
    // When execute, userRouter hook returns a router object
    const router = useRouter();
    const user = false;

    // Check if the given route matches with router.pathname
    // router.pathname gives information about the route the user is on
    function isActive(route) {
      // return true or false
      return route === router.pathname;
    }

    // Apply active style to menu item if the function returns true
    <Menu.Item header active={isActive('/')}>
  }
  ```
